# Overview

CRUD API, this module have been a great learning experience learning the TypeScript language. I had basic knowledge about Web Services (endpoints and data interaction). In this project I implementing the CRUD API from zero while using OOP. I respect the MVC pattern which is essential to mantain our code organized and the responsibilities of logic, conextion and error validation well distributed. I also implement a list as a data structura and a recursion function to count the students filtering by the student programa.
